this assingment is introduction to kivi library in python.
we created gui for recomendations of bike trips in New York using kivi
we also created a wed service which sends reccomendation as well
the recommadations are based on past knowledge, 
we created an algorithm that ranks the recommendations base on number of past trips and returns top n recommendations
